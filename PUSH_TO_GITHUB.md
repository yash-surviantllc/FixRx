# 🚀 Push to GitHub - Quick Guide

## Step 1: Run Cleanup Script

**On Windows:**
```bash
cleanup.bat
```

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x cleanup.sh
./cleanup.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Remove temporary .md files
- ✅ Remove test scripts
- ✅ Check for node_modules
- ✅ Show git status

---

## Step 2: Review Changes

```bash
git status
```

You should see:
- ✅ Deleted files (temporary docs)
- ✅ New vendor screens
- ✅ Modified navigation files

---

## Step 3: Commit Cleanup

```bash
git commit -m "chore: cleanup temporary files and test scripts"
```

---

## Step 4: Add Your Vendor Work

```bash
# Add all vendor screens
git add FixRxMobile/src/screens/vendor/

# Add navigation changes
git add FixRxMobile/App.tsx
git add FixRxMobile/src/types/navigation.ts
git add FixRxMobile/src/navigation/MainTabs.tsx

# Check what's staged
git status
```

---

## Step 5: Commit Your Work

**Option A: Use the template**
```bash
git commit -F COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt
```

**Option B: Write your own**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add complete vendor dashboard and screens

- VendorDashboard with stats and requests
- NotificationsScreen with navigation
- ServiceRequestDetailScreen with actions
- All vendor management screens
- Phone validation and improvements"
```

---

## Step 6: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to main branch
git push origin main

# Or if you're on a different branch
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

---

2. Check "Commits" - Your commit should be there
3. Browse to `FixRxMobile/src/screens/vendor/`
